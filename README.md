# GSAP Animations Showcase (React + Vite)

A personal project and showcase of various animations and effects built with **React**, **Vite**, **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

This repository contains a collection of individual animation components, each demonstrating a different GSAP technique. The main page provides a routed hub to navigate to and view each animation separately.

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Home Page:** A grid-based home page with a "spotlight" mouse-follow effect.
- **Client-Side Routing:** Uses `react-router-dom` to provide a unique path for each animation component.
